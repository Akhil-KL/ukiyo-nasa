- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive search functionality with fuzzy matching
  - Search by exoplanet name, host star, planet type, or all fields
  - Database of 12+ detailed exoplanets with real astronomical data
  - Modal detail views with complete planet information
  - Physical properties, discovery information, habitability scores
  - Animated search results grid with smooth transitions
- **Database**: Includes famous exoplanets like Kepler-452b, HD 209458 b, TRAPPIST-1e, etc.

### 🌟 User Flow 3: Beginner Exploration & Learning
